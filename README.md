## Awake+

If you struggle waking up in the morning without hitting the snooze button or if you enjoy getting rewarded for things you already do, Awake+ is for you! We incorporate the psychological principle of gamification into our modified alarm clock to motivate you to get up in the morning. Our system is simple: wake up without hitting snooze to earn points which you can redeem for great rewards such as buy one get one frees at local restaurants and more.

The interface is user friendly and based on the standard Android Alarm Clock application so it won't require any new learning. Just download and start earning!
